description: Expert knowledge for Azure Pipelines development including troubleshooting, best practices, decision making, architecture & design patterns, limits & quotas, security, configuration, integrations & coding patterns, and deployment. Use when configuring YAML pipelines, agents, service connections, Key Vault secrets, artifacts, or app/container deployments, and other Azure Pipelines related development tasks. Not for Azure DevOps (use azure-devops), Azure Boards (use azure-boards), Azure Repos (use azure-repos), Azure Test Plans (use azure-test-plans).
compatibility: Requires network access. Uses mcp_microsoftdocs:microsoft_docs_fetch or fetch_webpage to retrieve documentation.

# Azure Pipelines Skill

This skill provides expert guidance for Azure Pipelines. Covers troubleshooting, best practices, decision making, architecture & design patterns, limits & quotas, security, configuration, integrations & coding patterns, and deployment. It combines local quick-reference content with remote documentation fetching capabilities.

## How to Use This Skill

> **IMPORTANT for Agent**: Use the **Category Index** below to locate relevant sections. For categories with line ranges (e.g., `L35-L120`), use `read_file` with the specified lines. For categories with file links (e.g., `[security.md](security.md)`), use `read_file` on the linked reference file

> **IMPORTANT for Agent**: If `metadata.generated_at` is more than 3 months old, suggest the user pull the latest version from the repository. If `mcp_microsoftdocs` tools are not available, suggest the user install it: [Installation Guide](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mcp/blob/main/README.md)

This skill requires **network access** to fetch documentation content:
- **Preferred**: Use `mcp_microsoftdocs:microsoft_docs_fetch` with query string `from=learn-agent-skill`. Returns Markdown.
- **Fallback**: Use `fetch_webpage` with query string `from=learn-agent-skill&accept=text/markdown`. Returns Markdown.

| Security | L86-L146 | Securing Azure Pipelines: auth for agents, service connections, secrets/Key Vault, permissions/approvals, artifact/repo protection, mobile signing, CodeQL/Advanced Security, and YAML hardening. |
| Configuration | L147-L486 | Configuring Azure Pipelines end to end: agents, triggers, variables, YAML schema, environments, deployment strategies, artifacts, and detailed task/step settings for build, test, and deployment. |
| Integrations & Coding Patterns | L487-L524 | Patterns for building/testing apps (ASP.NET, .NET, Java, Python, Ruby, Xcode), integrating tools (Slack, ServiceNow, Jenkins, Key Vault), and scripting/REST/Function automation in pipelines. |
| Deployment | L525-L589 | Deploying apps and containers via Azure Pipelines: agent setup (Windows/Linux/macOS/VMSS/deployment groups), release pipelines, Kubernetes/Service Fabric/Web Apps, and publishing/consuming build artifacts. |
